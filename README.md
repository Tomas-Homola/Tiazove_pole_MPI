# Method of Fundamental Solutions (MFS) for Earth's gravity potential

Semestral project, the task was to write the implementation of MFS in C/C++. Furthermore, the code had to be parallelized using the **MPI standard** for parallel computing on distributed memory systems. It has been successfully deployed to the computational cluster at the Department of Mathematics and Descriptive Geometry, Faculty of Civil Engineering, STU.
